## Live Demo

Visit the live site: [Global Startup Showcase](https://gurkha-technology-open-source.github.io/Global-Startup-Showcase/)

## Local Development

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v20 or higher
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)
- A local web server (Python, Node.js, or any HTTP server)

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Gurkha-Technology-Open-Source/Global-Startup-Showcase.git
cd Global-Startup-Showcase
```

2. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
npm install
```

3. **Build the project:**
```bash
npm run build        # Build both CSS and JS
npm run build:css    # Build only CSS
npm run build:js     # Build only JS
npm run lint         # Run ESLint to check code quality
```

4. **Start a local server:**
```bash
# Using Python
python3 -m http.server 8000

# Or using Node.js
npx serve

# Or using PHP
php -S localhost:8000
```

5. **Open your browser:**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:8000`

### Development Workflow

**Important:** When deploying to GitHub Pages, the build process runs automatically via GitHub Actions. You don't need to commit the `dist/` folder - it's automatically built on every push to the `main` branch.

For local development:
1. Make changes to files in `src/` directory
2. Run `npm run build` to see changes
3. Refresh your browser
4. Commit only source files (`src/`, `index.html`, etc.)
5. Push to GitHub - Actions will handle the build

### Project Scripts

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm run build` | Builds both CSS and JavaScript |
| `npm run build:css` | Compiles Tailwind CSS to dist/styles.css |
| `npm run build:js` | Minifies JavaScript to dist/app.js |
| `npm run lint` | Runs ESLint on source files |
| `npm run download-logos` | Downloads startup logos from URLs in data/startups.json |

## Adding a Startup

To add your startup to the showcase:

1. Fork this repository
2. Add your startup details to `data/startups.json`:
```json
{
  "id": 101,
  "name": "Your Startup Name",
  "logo": "assets/logos/placeholder.svg",
  "logoUrl": "https://yourwebsite.com/logo.png",
  "description": "Brief description of your startup",
  "category": "Your Category",
  "website": "https://yourwebsite.com",
  "socials": {
    "facebook": "https://facebook.com/yourpage",
    "twitter": "https://twitter.com/yourhandle",
    "linkedin": "https://linkedin.com/company/yourcompany"
  },
  "country": "Your Country",
  "region": "Your Region",
  "founded": 2024,
  "founders": [
    "Founder 1",
    "Founder 2"
  ],
  "funding": "$1M",
  "investors": [
    "Investor 1",
    "Investor 2"
  ],
  "ceo": "CEO Name"
}
```
3. **Option A:** Add `logoUrl` field with your logo URL - GitHub Actions will automatically download it
4. **Option B:** Manually add your logo (SVG or PNG) to `assets/logos/` and update the `logo` field
5. Create a pull request

**Note:** If you provide a `logoUrl`, our automated system will download and optimize the logo. Otherwise, please ensure your logo file is under 100KB and in SVG or PNG format.

**How it works:** The logo download system automatically:
1. Downloads the image from `logoUrl`
2. Saves it to `assets/logos/` with a sanitized filename
3. Updates the `logo` field in the JSON with the local path
4. JavaScript reads the `logo` field and displays it on the card

See [Logo Flow Documentation](docs/logo-flow.md) for complete details.

## Data Visualization with Chart.js

This project uses [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/), a popular open-source JavaScript charting library, to provide interactive data visualizations of the startup ecosystem. Chart.js is MIT licensed and offers flexible, responsive charts that work seamlessly with our application.

### Available Charts

The Statistics Dashboard displays four interactive charts:

1. **Startups by Category** - Bar chart showing the distribution of startups across different industry categories
2. **Startups by Country** - Doughnut chart displaying the top 10 countries with the most startups
3. **Startups by Region** - Pie chart showing the geographic distribution of startups across global regions
4. **Founding Year Trends** - Line chart illustrating startup founding trends over time

### Features

- **Responsive Design** - Charts automatically resize based on screen size
- **Dark Mode Support** - Chart colors and themes adapt to the current theme (light/dark mode)
- **Collapsible Section** - Users can show/hide the charts section with a toggle button
- **Accessibility** - All charts include proper ARIA labels and roles for screen readers
- **Interactive Tooltips** - Hover over chart elements to see detailed information

### Why Chart.js?

We chose Chart.js for several reasons:

- **Open Source** - Fully open source under the MIT license
- **Lightweight** - Small bundle size with excellent performance
- **Well-Maintained** - Active development with regular updates and security patches
- **Extensive Documentation** - Comprehensive guides and examples
- **Customizable** - Highly flexible with extensive configuration options
- **Accessibility** - Built-in support for accessible chart rendering

## Intelligent Search with Fuse.js

This project uses [Fuse.js](https://www.fusejs.io/), a powerful lightweight fuzzy-search library, to provide an intelligent search experience. Fuse.js is Apache-2.0 licensed and delivers fast, typo-tolerant search with relevance scoring.

### Search Features

- **Fuzzy Matching** - Find results even with typos or partial matches
- **Multi-Field Search** - Search across name, description, category, country, region, founders, and investors
- **Weighted Results** - More relevant fields (like name) have higher priority in search results
- **Performance** - Fast client-side search with no server required

### How It Works

The search intelligently ranks results based on relevance:

1. **Name** (highest weight) - Startup names get the most priority
2. **Description** (high weight) - Detailed descriptions are highly relevant
3. **Category** (medium weight) - Industry categories help narrow results
4. **Location** (medium weight) - Country and region information
5. **People** (lower weight) - Founders and investors are searchable but with lower priority

### Why Fuse.js?

We chose Fuse.js for several reasons:

- **Open Source** - Fully open source under the Apache-2.0 license
- **Zero Dependencies** - Lightweight with no external dependencies
- **Typo Tolerance** - Finds results even when users make spelling mistakes
- **Configurable** - Highly customizable scoring and matching algorithms
- **Client-Side** - Fast, local search with no backend required
- **Well-Documented** - Clear documentation and examples

## Smooth Animations with AOS

This project uses [AOS (Animate On Scroll)](https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/), an open-source library for scroll animations. AOS is MIT licensed and provides smooth, performant animations triggered by scrolling.

### Animation Features

- **Scroll-Triggered** - Elements animate as they enter the viewport
- **Performance** - Hardware-accelerated CSS animations
- **Customizable** - Multiple animation types and timing options
- **Accessibility** - Respects user's `prefers-reduced-motion` settings
- **Easy Integration** - Simple data attributes for animation configuration

### Why AOS?

We chose AOS for several reasons:

- **Open Source** - Fully open source under the MIT license
- **Lightweight** - Small footprint with minimal performance impact
- **User Experience** - Smooth animations enhance visual appeal
- **Accessibility** - Built-in support for reduced motion preferences
- **Easy to Use** - Simple API with data attributes
