## Visual Enhancements and Dark Mode Implementation

**Objective:** Improve the project visually with visual enhancements and eye candy.

**Status:** In Progress

**Completed Steps:**

*   **Visual Enhancements:**
    *   Added AOS (Animate On Scroll) library for scroll animations.
    *   Added a subtle background pattern for both light and dark modes.
    *   Improved the header with a gradient.
    *   Added box shadows to startup cards to make them "pop" more.
    *   Improved the "Scroll to Top" button.
*   **Dark Mode:**
    *   Implemented dark mode using Tailwind CSS.
    *   Added a dark mode toggle button.
    *   Added dark mode styles for all elements on the page.
*   **Code Refactoring:**
    *   Moved styles from `index.html` to `src/styles.css`.
    *   Replaced hardcoded styles with Tailwind CSS classes where possible.
    *   Refactored the dark mode implementation to be more efficient and easier to maintain.

**Next Steps:**

1.  **Finalize CSS Refactoring:** The last action was to add the `body` selector before the `.dark body` selector in `src/styles.css`. This needs to be completed.
2.  **Review and Test:**
    *   Review all the changes made to ensure consistency and correctness.
    *   Thoroughly test the website in both light and dark modes to identify and fix any visual glitches or bugs.
    *   Test the website on different screen sizes to ensure responsiveness.
